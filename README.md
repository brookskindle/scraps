I'm a huge fan of learning. I find that learning by doing is one of the best
ways to understand a concept.

This repository exists as a way for me to try out new things and to mess around
with a topic that I am interested in. Additionally, it has the added benefit of
being searchable in case I want to refer to something that I did at a later
date.
